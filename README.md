Online Cinema - A multi-device video synchronization tool
=========================================================

## Introduction
This project will develop a real-time online cinema for multi-users which enables different users in the network to watch a movie with arbitrary at the same time, whereas using self-destructive mechanism to ensure the legality of the video sharing.
N.B. This project https://github.com/SeffyVon/OCJavafx/ is just for the client part. I would upload the server side soon.

## Components
* A database for the user and group record, which enables user to register, login, create group, add other users in the group.
*	A video file sharing system that ensures the video files can not be accessed from outside the system, and the video-file would be self-destruct after 24 hours from receiving.
*	A real-time sharing progress system that allows user to synchronize the progress of the film in their devices.

## Features of the OCJavaFX
* Users could create or join groups that run movie-watching session
* Legal video sharing (The video file sharing system encrypts the video files can not be accessed from outside the system, and the video-file would be self-destruct after 24 hours from receiving.)
* In the session everyone watch the movie synchronisedly, as if they were watching on the same device
* Chatting room in the session to share your feelings with your friend in real time

## Development Milestones
*TBD*
